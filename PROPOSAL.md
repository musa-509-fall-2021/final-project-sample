## Abstract

**Who is it for:** Community groups to advocate for their main streets. City officials to identify places where additional resources might be helpful.

**How will they use it:** The commerce department needs to keep track of the health of business districts month after month. Each quarter, during their strategic planning, this dashboard will serve as a central artifact for discussing where funds may need to be focused, and for assessing the impact of previous interventions. Overall, the trends surfaced with this dashboard will allow Commerce to take a more iterative approach to community development.

Because the pace of change for a business district can be slow, the dashboard will focus mainly on year-over-year change for a handful of metrics. In particular:
- foot traffic (when and how much)
- internal and facade renovations (how prevalent and how recent)
- diversity of businesses
- local ownership of businesses
