# Proposal: Commercial Corridor Investments

## Abstract

The commerce department needs to keep track of the health of business districts month after month. Each quarter, during their strategic planning, this dashboard will serve as a central artifact for discussing where funds may need to be focused, and for assessing the impact of previous interventions. Overall, the trends surfaced with this dashboard will allow Commerce to take a more iterative approach to community development, by having a more up-to-date view on the data.

Because the pace of change for a business district can be slow, and because patterns of change in public space are often seasonal, the dashboard will focus mainly on year-over-year change for a handful of metrics. In particular:
- foot traffic (when and how much)
- internal and facade renovations (how prevalent and how recent)
- diversity of businesses owners (if possible, from OEO or estimated from census)
- local ownership of businesses
- overall corridor health

These metrics will allow stakeholders to target different programs at each district. For example:
- low rates of local business ownership may prompt business education programs for community residents
- increasing average time since
- low foot traffic in the face of other positively trending metrics may prompt public space activation events

## Stakeholders

* City officials who want to identify commercial districts where additional resources might be helpful.
* Community groups that advocate for their main streets.

## Data sources

- **City commercial corridors** -- [OpenDataPhilly](https://opendataphilly.org/dataset/commercial-corridors/resource/b8cf80de-88af-4eb7-9392-95980fef319b), updated "as needed". No information on commerce funding since 2016, but commercial corridor boundaries change infrequently enough that the gap is not egregious.
- **L&I business licenses** -- [OpenDataPhilly](https://opendataphilly.org/dataset/licenses-and-inspections-business-licenses), updated "daily" (according to city [metadata](https://metadata.phila.gov/#home/datasetdetails/5543865a20583086178c4ed2/representationdetails/5e985a5e344ed50018936bb8/))
- **L&I building and zoning permits** -- [OpenDataPhilly](https://opendataphilly.org/dataset/licenses-and-inspections-building-permits), updated "daily" (according to city [metadata](https://metadata.phila.gov/#home/datasetdetails/5543868920583086178c4f8f/representationdetails/5e9a01ac801624001585ca11/))
- **OEO M/W/D Owned Businesses** -- [OpenDataPhilly](https://metadata.phila.gov/#home/datasetdetails/5543867b20583086178c4f59/representationdetails/5579e08f597e56d77b402f91/), updated "continuously"? Though not likely, since all records were added Jan 5, 2017.
- **Registerd Community Organization boundaries** -- [OpenDataPhilly](https://opendataphilly.org/dataset/registered-community-organizations), updated as needed (created 2014, most recent updates from 2021)
- **SafeGraph foot traffic** -- Ideally I would set up a [monthly delivery](https://docs.safegraph.com/docs/bulk-data-delivery) from SafeGraph, but it's uncertain if that's available on an academic account. May simulate that for now, by manually extracting latest extract to GCS each month. Possibly use a combination of manual bulk data access and [API calls](https://docs.safegraph.com/reference#places-api-overview-new). Schema docs are [here](https://docs.safegraph.com/docs/monthly-patterns).
- **US Census Block Group demographics** -- BigQuery public datasets, updated with the national census, i.e. yearly estimates at its most frequent
